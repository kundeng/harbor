# Harbor v2 (Python) â€” Release Notes
 
 This branch migrates Harbor to a Python core executed inside a runner container.
 Use these steps during the v2 sprints. Legacy v1 guidance remains below.
 
 - Build runner image
   ```sh
   just -f bin/justfile build-runner
   ```
 - Tag and changelog (manual for now)
   - Versioning: annotate in commit and update CHANGE summary in this file
   - Tag on `v2` branch: `git tag -a v2.<x> -m "Harbor v2 <x>" && git push --tags`
 - Docs
   - README updated with v2 structure (etc/lib, etc/stacks, etc/runner, bin/justfile)
   - Export ConPort snapshot for records: see `conport_export/`
